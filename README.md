APRS BOM Weather Sender

A set of automated scripts I wrote one week in Canberra in 2002 to get BOM weather data and post it to the APRS network.

The scripts will need to be updated to get and parse the latest weather data and the APRS packet generator will likely need work as the python has moved on a lot since 2002.

This has been primarily uploaded for historic value, but everyone is free to use and modify as they see fit, within the GPL of course.

If anyone has historic data going back to 2002, you may be able to see the weather objects I posited back then.
